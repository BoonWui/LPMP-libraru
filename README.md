## Description

LMPM is an efficient method to compute the minimal number of coins for a target sum using *modular pruning* and *early stopping*, making it feasible for extremely large targets (up to trillions) with irregular coin sets.

## Features

- Works with very large datasets
- Minimal memory usage
- Early stopping to reduce computation
- Optional alternative splits for irregular coin sets

## Installation

Just download lmpm.py and import it:

```python

from lmpm import minimal_coins
